    <h3>GAMING TERMS</h3> <br>

    <h4 class="odd">LADDER TOURNAMENT</h4> <br>

    <p class="even">A ladder tournament (also known as a ladder competition or pyramid tournament) is a form of tournament for games and sports. <br> <br>

        Unlike many tournaments, which usually have an element of elimination, ladder competitions can go on indefinitely.
        In a ladder competition, players are listed as if on the rungs of a ladder.
        The objective for a player is to reach the highest rung of the ladder.

    <h4 class="odd">SCRIM</h4>

    <p class="even">
        In gaming, a scrim is a test match between two e-sports teams. Scrim is short for "scrimmage". <br> <br>
        Scrimmages are very common in other sports such as soccer or football in various forms and were therefore simply adopted into gaming. <br> <br>
        In e-sports, a scrim is most similar to a test match in soccer, for example before a World Cup or the start of the season. <br> <br>

    <h4 class="odd">MAPS</h4>

    <p class="even">
        The cartographic and planimetric language of architecture is also common to the world of video games.
        Many video games base much of their experience on interaction with one or more maps, through which users orient themselves to find out where they are and where they are supposed to be.<br> <br>

        One example is the Civilization saga, a series of empire management games created from 1991 to date. All versions are played on a map, a geographical view of the world that represents different areas, available resources, geopolitical balance, and other factors. These variants are the rules of the game, the situation the player faces; the map becomes a dynamic fabric, ie, the interface that makes up the game. <br> <br>
